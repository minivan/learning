# Setting OKRs for writing

I'd like to try. Yesterday I reflected on [[2021-12-08 â€” learning to write]], and I decided:

> To summarize, I'd like to learn to write because I feel that it will help me think. My first step in that is developing a writing habit, which is around two months of sitting down and writing for an hour or so. We'll revise then.

This makes for a pretty easy OKR for writing. For now, I'm working on developing a habit, and ensuring quantity, and I know that as I'm doing that, the levels of quality will start unfolding themselves.

I'd like to set these OKRs monthly, so that I can revisit them more often, but still have the time to develop a habit of sorts.

So, this month I'd like to develop a writing habit and I will know that by the fact that every day in December I will spend around 20 minutes writing things (preferably from the [[ðŸ—“  Editorial Calendar]])
