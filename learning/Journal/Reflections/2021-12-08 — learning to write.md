# Why am I learning to write?

I'm not sure. People on the internet say it's a great thing and it has helped them and I trust them, so I'd like to learn as well.
A couple of years ago I challenged myself to put in 1000 words a day for a whole month. The practice did a couple of magical things to me. First, it improved my English. A lot. Secondly, I had this feeling of being able to *formulate* my thoughts, which is unusual for me. When I talk, I tend to ramble around points, and end them with a whimper. Within that month I ended up with, what I felt, better work being done simply because I could communicate better. I'd like to communicate better and think more clearly.

I don't have specific goals in mind, I just have this feeling that if I stick to it, good things will happen.

But there are different kinds of writing. There's fiction, lyrics, poetry, articles, tweets, etc. They are not simply [[Genre Studies|genre studies]], they are much more different at their core. What kind of writing do I want to learn? I actually don't know. It would *probably* be cool to publish some of that writing online to show to other people, maybe it would be helpful to them, but a part of me disagrees, I don't know why.

In any case, I still think it's important to define *some* success criteria for the current step I'm in. It could be as much as showing up for a month, writing for an hour a day. It could be more specific â€” publish 14 blog posts in a year. It's not a goal that I'd use to aim for, it's a goal that structures my practice. And if, while I'm sitting down, I see a better, different goal, I can change it. The goal police is not going to prevent me from doing so. I'll start with developing the habit to sit down and write.

To summarize, I'd like to learn to write because I feel that it will help me think. My first step in that is developing a writing habit, which is around two months of sitting down and writing for an hour or so. We'll revise then.
