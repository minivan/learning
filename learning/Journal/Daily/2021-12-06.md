### Plan for today's practice:

- [[Writing Practice]]
  - [x] Create an editorial calendar, add a couple of notes, start refining them
  - [x] Spend 1 pomodoro writing

07:42 Started practicing
08:30 Wrapped up 2 pomomdoros on organizing and writing

### Review:

It was nice to pluck stuff from the books I read, and I'm sure I'll have to organize the writing practice differently, but so far it's all right.

09:32 I started another writing session, writing about [[A personal Kanban]]. 09:59 Ended.

### Review:

This was quite a bit for today. To make it easier for myself for tomorrow, I'd like to start with a different prompt.
