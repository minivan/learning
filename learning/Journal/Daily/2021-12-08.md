Today's practice is pretty much the same as what I had yesterday. For now, it's going to be:

- [ ] 2 pomodoros writing something from the editorial calendar
- [ ] 1 pomodoro populating my garden

I'd like to add something else, though — I'd like to add a bit of meta work and better understand:

- Why am I learning to write
- What does success look like for the current step?

- [x] If I'm out of ideas where to start, it can be a [[Journal/Reflections/2021-12-08 — learning to write]].
