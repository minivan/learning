Plan for today's practice:

[[Writing Practice]]
- [x] Write for 2 pomodoros from the [[ðŸ—“  Editorial Calendar]]
- [x] 1 pomo of tending to the garden


Started the practice at 7:30, wrapped it up at 8:45-ish. I'd like to make it better tomorrow by looking a bit more into specific *exercises* as opposed to simply showing up. So perhaps I could find a couple of exercises that would help me focus my writing. [[ðŸ“š Bird by Bird|Anne Lamott]] writes about [[Short Assignments]] and [[Shitty First Drafts]] as the tools to *get better*.

Another book that explores this is [[ðŸ“š Writing the Natural Way]], which is something I'd love to read.

In any case, today's practice is done, I'd like to try the same tomorrow: [[Journal/Daily/2021-12-08]].
