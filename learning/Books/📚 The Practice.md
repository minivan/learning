# Notes

- The industrial economy demands obedience and compliance. We trust the system and people give us what we need as long as we follow the path they set for us
- We focus too much on the outcome
- Learning to Juggle: Learning requires a simple insight: Catching the ball isn't the point
	- We begin with just one ball. The point is to throw, not to catch.
- Identity fuels action, and action creates habits, and habits are part of a practice, and practice is the single best way to get where you seek to go.
	- Before you're a "bestselling author", you're a author, and writers author.
- *META: there are a lot of appeals to authority in this book*

- *META: This is a bit motivating — it helps me remember that I actually like practicing*
- **Consider the locksmith:** a locksmith tries many keys. Every key that fails is a data point. The software engineer doesn't take bugs personally.

# Review

100 pages in, I'm giving up, it's not for me. The book can serve as a lift-me-up, but it's written in such a self-serving way, it's difficult to take it seriously. It takes the same point over and over again and does it through short, almost tweet-sized platitudes that are, undoubtedly, applicable, but lack any kind of nuance. I get it — I find myself repeating — you'll give me an example and tell me why practicing is important and then you'll move to another short chapter.

And maybe I'm reading this wrong. Perhaps this book wasn't written as a book (it wasn't), and more like a series of blog posts, each one giving you the motivation to sit down and do the work. Perhaps reading the book as one normally would is like drinking from a firehose. I heard that you can't feel the nuance when you drink from the firehose, either.

# Quotes

>The practice is not the means to the output, the practice is the output, because the practice is all we can control.

>Your work is too important to be left to how you feel today. On the other hand, committing to an action can change how we feel. If we act as though we trust the process and do the work, then the feelings will follow.
