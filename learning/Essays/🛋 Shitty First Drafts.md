## Notes

- Very few writers know what they're doing until they've done it
- The right words and sentences just do not come out. It _is_ like pulling teeth.
- The only way you can get anything written is to write really, really shitty first drafts
- If one of the characters wants to say "well, so what, mr. poopy pants", you let her. **No one is going to see it.**
- There can be something at the end of page six that's actually good and something you couldn't get to without typing out the first five pages.
- Writing food reviews example
- Just type, just make your fingers move
- The first draft is the down draft — you just get it down
- The second draft is the up draft — you fix it up
- The third draft you check every tooth
