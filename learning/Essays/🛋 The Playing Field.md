# Notes

The mindset of "this is happening to me" is very hard to change.

There are 5 levels of what Duncan calles "the game":
- Apprentice — learning the game
- Expert — mastering the game you were taught
- Professional — making the game you were taught fit your own strenghts and weaknesses
- Master — changing the game you play as part of your own self-expression and operating at scale
- Steward — become part of the playing field itself and mentoring the next generation

### Level 1. Apprentice
- Graduate -> moves into playing the game full-time
- the best thing you can do here is find a mentor.

### Level 2. Expert
- Move from processing other people's research agendas to generating ideas
- Most of the time they have a somewhat static sense of identity, like "I am a value investor like Warren Buffet". It puts them in a game that is defined entirely by their peers
- The essential skill is spotting the key drivers of the situation
  - This is similar to [[Developing a Gut Feeling]]

### Level 3. Professional
- They shed the habits of imitation in favor of their own style, with their own strength
- Their expertise has developed beyond what's generally acceptable in the field
- **the critical challenge is to find a way to be exposed to Level 4**. If your world consists only of Level 2 or Level 3, you'll stay there.

> Beyond an initial improvement in strength, flexibility and feel, there is little increasing accumulation of speed through sheer volume of swimming. …instead, athletes move up to the top ranks through qualitative jumps:noticeable changes in their techniques, discipline, and attitude, are accomplished usually through a change in setting, e.g. working with a new coach, new friends, etc.who work at a higher level. What I have called “levels” are better described as “worlds” or “spheres.”

### Level 4. Master — Changing the Game You Play

- These are the people who seem to move effortlessly between [[Genre Studies|genres]] and clearly cut roles.
- Key trait: *open-minded with a point of view*
  - these people are not only advancing their agenda and design, they are also making space for the modification or expansion of their agenda or design. In other words, they are inquiring about the design itself.
  - read [[📚 Mastery (Robert Greene)]]
  - *sometimes the ability to shift perspective involves an empathetic mindset*
- Key trait: *relationship to time*
  - Good investment managers know they will be investing for decades
    - HOWEVER, it's more likely to happen in a series of sprints and recoveries
- Key trait: *relationship to risk*
  - A level 4 player has a much higher risk tolerance.
  >This greater risk tolerance may come in part from the fact that the Level 4 investor does not view his identity as at risk in a given investment, and instead sees interacting with the markets as an occasion for rapid feedback on his own development.

### Level 5. Steward — Becoming Part of the Game Itself
