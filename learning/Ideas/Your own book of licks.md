Justin of JustinGuitar has a series of *excellent* episodes, showcasing how he does his 1 on 1 lessons. It's great, it shows what kind of homework he gives, it highlights how much of a lead does the student has, and it's a show of his grace and care as a teacher for all ages and levels of experience.

A couple of these episodes are special, as the student is Lee Anderton â€” an otherwise experienced guitar player and youtuber. It's someone who sells guitars and is, what we'd call, pretty good at the instrument. Yet Justin helps him get out of his creative rut and together, they work on a couple of techniques for Lee to practice.

> have you thought about doing a lick book before? When I watch you play, there are some licks that occur more often. And that's okay, I do that as well. [...] Play along something, write down the things you're doing. And in the first couple of sessions, you'll write down twenty or so of them. Then, in the next sessions try not to use the ones you've already written down. Write down some more
> Later, when you have a book, we can look a technically what's going on, combining the new licks with your old ones, and so on.

The book of licks is an invaluable practice tool. Take what you already do, write it down, understand the context it fits in, and then practice it.

That's how you develop a toolbox that's yours.
