Just like with food consumption, we don't have to eat *everything*. We can be more discerning towards what, when, and how we consume information.

This is one of the key skills outlined in [[ðŸ’¡ Media Literacy]] â€” crap detection. What do we consume, is it worth it?

It's an interesting chicken-and-egg and it's wonderful how our brains work here. We don't know what an article is going to bring us until we *read* the article. Unless, of course, we know what the article is about. We have an idea of what "10 ways to practice scales" will give us, but no clue about what "The truth about learning to code", and that makes the second one somewhat more enticing.

The truth is, there will be more articles. There will always be a next one, and one that hits precisely what *we think* we need. That's their business.

So, how do you keep consuming things without being overwhelmed? And how can you still allow new ideas to come and keep your sanity and focus?

There are a couple of strategies to that.

The first one is delaying things. There's a magazine, called [Delayed Gratification](https://www.slow-journalism.com/) and it publishes the news from six months ago. Because these news are not as current, they have a different perspective â€” a more grounded, more like a vignette that has historical value. 
You can do the same thing in your consumption. Most books, articles, videos, they have an expiration date. And, while skimming, you can check whether they are still fresh and worth noticing.
One way you can do that is by using a to-do list to add the items you'd like to read, but set a date of one month from now. When you'll pick it up, then, you'll see whether it still makes sense and whether it's still fresh and relevant to what you're doing. A lot of the things won't be.

The second strategy is using authority. Loved one of Seth Godin's books? Take more.

I have a list of people I trust to do great stuff. That's enough for me to read. I can use their references and their taste to discover things. I can join groups and talk to people and use their curation to get to the things I'd like. At the end of the day, I can use 10% of my time to consume things that are on the front page of hacker news. But the first and the bulk comes from people I trust.
