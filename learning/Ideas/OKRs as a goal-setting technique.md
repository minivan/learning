[[ðŸ’¡ OKRs]] are powerful. In short, OKRs are a goal-setting technique that starts with a clear objective, and challenges you to split that objective in Key Results â€” binary yes/no metrics that, in ensemble, tell you whether you've achieved the objective.

This is great for organizational alignment, since it takes an objective that everyone understands differently and splits it into clearly achievable targets.

I also think this could be dangerous and, at the same time, rewarding for learning.

Here's an example, you've always wanted to learn to play the piano. If you're anything like me, you'd probably go and get a course or something, or sign up for an online tutorial to get yourself up to speed, to develop the finger exerices, etc. Or maybe you have a teacher in your area and you'll sign up for that â€” a teacher who helps guide your piano practice.

Neither of these things will tell you where to go with your piano studies. They might give you songs, scales, and techniques, and it's possible that that's what you want. 

A couple of years ago I started to learn to sing. I found a fantastic teacher (I didn't appreciate it at the time), and I came to him saying "hello, I can't sing and I'd like to learn to sing". He asked me to sing and told me "I can work with that". Then he told me to bring songs, which left me flabbergasted â€” I expected him to give me the program to learn from. But that wasn't the case, he wanted to make sure that I learn the things I love.

My bass teacher used to say: "Tina Weymouth didn't know how to play bass. She was part of the Talking Heads first." If what I'd like is to join a band, then scales might not help.

So, back to the example of the piano. Let's say, in a year, what would make you very happy about learning to play the piano? Playing a song or two at the local open mic? Wait, no OKRs yet! If that's the dream, you can distill it into smaller steps. For example, you can look at whether it's realistic to get there in a year. You can take a look at a course and see how many hours do they have. If it's 400 hours, will you have that + some practice time for a year? If yes, then it's likely that you might succeed in this. Then you can move to the next step.

The next step is figuring out that small piece, something that you can start with.
