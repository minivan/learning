# Do goals even work?

When trying to learn something, is it helpful to set a goal about how are you going to achieve it?

I think yes. I think it's really important, although there are important conditions.

## Why goals don't matter

### 1. They focus on things that are outside of your control

Goals are focused on the outcome and often include things that are completely out of your control as a practiciioner.

### 2. They set you in daydreaming mode, which isn't helpful

### 3. Goals prevent you from seeing opportunities

## Making goals relevant again

### 1. Use goals to inform your initial practice, create a timeline, and do a reality check.

### 2. Revise your goals with fervor

### 3. You have to know a little bit before you start setting goals
- For example, if you *just* started playing the piano, and your goal is "play at a local open mic", it's difficult to assess how difficult or easy that is.
