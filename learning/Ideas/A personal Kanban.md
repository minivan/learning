- A personal [[ðŸ’¡ Kanban]] is a useful tool for learning
- It can also help with [[Mindful consumption]]
- What could be the states?
	- Time periods
	- Todo / doing / Done
	- Levels of learning
- If you're doing a TODO/DOING/DONE, the challenge is in making sure that the item clearly defines *the transition to the next state*.
    - For example, you're learning to write.
    - If it's a kanban of *doing things*, this item is perfectly fine. It's not very helpful, but it's all right. You can make it better by providing more context, so that you have all the information you need before you get started.
      - For example, you can change that to: write an essay about how to make kanban boards useful
    - This is better. However, if I'm using a TODO/DOING/DONE-style of kanban, it's difficult to know when do I move that to done. When I have a file on my desktop? Will I create a new work item when I move this to "done"? I can improve this by refining the acceptance criteria:
      - *Write an essay about how to make kanban boards more useful and publish is to the blog*
    - This is better, but there's another important step here. The "write an essay and publish" are actually three steps: write, edit, and publish. I don't have to finish these steps at the same time (as a matter of fact, it's better if I don't â€” writing and editing are better separated by sleep)
    - This is better captured if I either add a checklist (so that I'm aware where I'm blocked) or if I add two more columns to the kanban:
      - TODO / WRITING / EDITING / PUBLISHING / DONE
    - I'd even rename the TODO lane into "ideas", and the DONE into "published".
- However, this creates a Kanban only about learning to *write*, not about learning in general. What if you are trying to learn to play guitar? There are many aspects to the learning the instrument â€” from *practicing* scales on a frequent basis, to working on a repertoire, and revisiting that repertoire.
