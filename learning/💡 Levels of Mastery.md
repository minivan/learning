For anything you study, there are several levels of mastering it, similarly to the levels defined in [[ðŸ›‹ The Playing Field]]

## Level 1. Curiosity & Appreciation

There's a first level in which you're curious about the field. Pianos, coffee, or stocks, this is the level in which you develop a broad categorization of things within the field. With guitar listening, you start feeling the difference between something more complicated and something simple. You develop an understanding of genres. You touch upon the vocabulary used by the professionals.

At this level, there is little practice, there's mostly orientation. You absorb as much as possible without having an opinion about things. You don't know which coffee is good and which one is bad, you develop the *sense of difference* between the different kinds of coffee.

You go to improv shows, download "the 100 greatest guitar solos", and binge-watch your country's greatest baking show. In some time, you develop an appreciation towards the craft. And then you start going deeper.

## Level 2. Developing a sense of progress

If the exposure from the previous level is more entertaining, ad-hoc, YouTube-algorithm-driven, later you'll get to explore things on your own. "What makes a good draftsman?", you might ask. "Why do people laugh about *the lick?*". Previously, you were exposed to the vocabulary, now you're into **memes**.

This level also exposes you to people in the field, educational materials, and *the discourse*. At a certain point, though, you'll develop a *sense* of the map (it's very likely to be a fraught one, but it's still great because it gives us confidence), and that will be enough to develop a [[A Learning Roadmap]]. It will be a vague roadmap, with unknown endings, drawn in very crude pencil, and that's the point.

At this level you can also [[OKRs as a goal-setting technique|conceptualize success]]. It's going to take several iterations to get anywhere near *realistic next steps*, but you'll develop a sense of what's possible. It's not going to be possible to be the next Coltrane, but it's going to be possible to join a sax band. By the end of this level, you have an idea of what it takes to do that.

At this point, you'll also probably start looking for mentors or teachers. Someone who has been there, someone to tell you what the best practices are (or better yet, to *show* you). 

Many people stay at this point. You'll learn a couple of songs on the piano and get them for every second family gathering. It takes little effort (but still, non-zero effort) to keep this level up, and the skills gained until here do not dissipate quickly.

## Level 3. Practice & Quantity

Simply sitting down at the piano every day and playing *anything* only works up to a certain point. After you know **where you want to initially get**, and **what does it take to get there,** you can start designing *your* practice.

This is where it gets interesting. You have probably been practicing before, but this is slightly different. Before you were given a practice routine: "practice scales", or "write 720 words", at this point you've already practiced enough in the prescribed way that you have a better awareness of your strengths and weaker spots that you can design a practice for yourself. This new routine will make YOU better.

This level is the hardest to comfortably stay in. It might take months or years, the feedback loop is long, and the results might seem further and further away.
There are a couple techniques that can help reduce the cost of willpower required to continue the practice:
- make a commitment â€” write about the practice, make the improvement visible
- join a community â€” a band, a troupe, a club
- set clearer intermediate goals

By this point, we're also developing *taste.* Taste is insanely difficult to teach.

## Level 4-ish. Style & Genres




## On the boundaries between levels

- there are none. Just like there are no boundaries between eras.
