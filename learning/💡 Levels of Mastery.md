For anything you study, there are several levels of mastering it, similarly to the levels defined in [[ðŸ›‹ The Playing Field]]

## Level 1. Curiosity & Appreciation

There's a first level in which you're curious about the field. Pianos, coffee, or stocks, this is the level in which you develop a broad categorization of things within the field. With guitar listening, you start feeling the difference between something more complicated and something simple. You develop an understanding of genres. You touch upon the vocabulary used by the professionals.

At this level, there is little practice, there's mostly orientation. You absorb as much as possible without having an opinion about things. You don't know which coffee is good and which one is bad, you develop the *sense of difference* between the different kinds of coffee.

You go to improv shows, download "the 100 greatest guitar solos", and binge-watch your country's greatest baking show. In some time, you develop an appreciation towards the craft. And then you start going deeper.

## Level 2. Developing a sense of progress

If the exposure from the previous level is more entertaining, ad-hoc, YouTube-algorithm-driven, later you'll get to explore things on your own. "What makes a good draftsman?", you might ask. "Why do people laugh about *the lick?*". Previously, you were exposed to the vocabulary, now you're into **memes**.

This level also exposes you to people in the field, educational materials, and *the discourse*. At a certain point, though, you'll develop a *sense* of the map (it's very likely to be a fraught one, but it's still great because it gives us confidence), and that will be enough to develop a [[A Learning Roadmap]]. It will be a vague roadmap, with unknown endings, drawn in very crude pencil, and that's the point.

At this level you can also [[OKRs as a goal-setting technique|conceptualize success]]. It's going to take several iterations to get anywhere near *realistic next steps*, but you'll develop a sense of what's possible. It's not going to be possible to be the next Coltrane, but it's going to be possible to join a sax band. By the end of this level, you have an idea of what it takes to do that.

At this point, you'll also probably start looking for mentors or teachers. Someone who has been there, someone to tell you what the best practices are (or better yet, to *show* you). 


## Level 3. Practice & Quantity

Simply sitting down at the piano every day and playing *anything* only works up to a certain point. After you know what it takes to 

## On the boundaries between levels

- there are none. Just like there are no boundaries between eras.
