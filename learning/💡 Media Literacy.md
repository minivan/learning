Introduced in [ðŸ“¹ 21st Century Media Literacies](https://vimeo.com/5659525). Like riding a bike, there are skills that are needed in the 21st century
- Attention
  - Focused attention is priviledged. That's not necessarily a good thing. Multitasking is a survival mechanism. You need focused attention when you're going to do surgery.
- Participation (blogs, twitters, wikis)
- Collaboration
- Network
- Critical consumption (crap detection)
  - It's up to you to detect whether this is porn/spam/conspiracy. Ability to sift through information and detect what's up. Where do I spend my attention. What do I open a tab for, what do I bookmark, what do I consume now.
