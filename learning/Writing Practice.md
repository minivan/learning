I'd like to practice writing. I *know* that this page is going to evolve somewhere beyond [[ðŸ›‹ Shitty First Drafts|a shitty first draft]], and I'd like to see it get somewhere.

For now, though, I'd like to learn to write, edit, and publish. And for now, I have no idea what that means.

# December 2021
- The OKR for the month is to develop a writing practice
  - I'll see that if, during all of December, I'll sit down for at least 20 minutes and write something from the [[ðŸ—“  Editorial Calendar]]
